# Career Ladder – Product Security

## Approach

As with all ladders in the version, we set out to streamline the skills and career stages to provide better clarity of what is required as you progress on your career journey. This ladder should be used in conjunction with the Career Stages ladder to provide a holistic view of both the business and technical requirements for each career stage. Each skill is assigned a number that can be used to track and correlate with external systems/processes.

**NOTE:** In Version 2.1 coming in early 2025, we will provide sample interview questions for each skill, so folks can assess a potential candidate for this level.

## Functional Areas in Product Security

While BSIMM or SAMM has a hundred \+ product security tasks areas, it has been our observation that few if any organizations in our target audience come anywhere near completing a fraction of these on a repeatable basis. As a result, we have narrowed the scope of skills to those that we consistently see in the majority of the target audience companies we interact with. These include:

* Vulnerabilities \- The management of code defects within the product.  
* Testing – Validating the security of the products.  
* Designing – The reduction of security design flaws in the product.  
* Training – Teaching secure coding/design fundamentals.  
* Program – Running a product security practice.
