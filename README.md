# Security Ladders 2024

## Introduction

[**Product Security Group**](https://www.productsecuritygroup.com) (PSG) offers Security Ladders; a collection of documents to categorize the knowledge and experience expected of security experts at a given point during their careers.

## About Time

Well, yes. It has been almost 4 years since we first released our career laders out to the world. A lot has changed both in the industry and our thinking. You will see this reflected in the new ladders and skills. More on that later.

## Why
Well, in our journey through the ranks we had to make these up as we went. That coupled with the number of folks we mentor asking us how to advance, we felt the best way to help is to open source what we developed so the community could benefit from what we have learned. They are by no means complete but they are a good start for folks that need some guidance.

## Change Log

:new: **10/14/2024** - We created a new repo and will be dropping the new ladders as they complete the peer review process. 

## LinkedIn Series

We are going to do things a bit different this time and post out our discussions on Linkedin. We did not get alot of feedback on the previous platform so the hope is we can faciliate a more lively discussion. More to come as we post.   

## General structure

### Skills

Specific area folders in `root` specifies a specific career track in the security field. Initially, Security Ladders covered 7 security areas:

* Business Security Manager/ Chief Security Officer
* Information Risk / GRC
* Infrastructure Security
* Physical Security
* Application / Product Security
* Security Operations (SOC)

These initially included three file types:

* [AREA]_Skills.md - Expected functional duties/knowledge
* [AREA]_Salary.md - Salary/time-at-level expectations

## How do I use these files

1. Start with the function you are looking for and locate the folder.
2. Open the file (Abbreviation)_Skills.md - this contains the functional requirements for each level.
3. Find the level you are looking for and review the skills.
4. To determine where you sit in the salary department, we provided US salary information. Just a note: These are not based on some paid salary survey but what we actuially see in the indsutry in the Fall of 2024.

## Contributing

PSG anticipates, with collaboration throughout the security field, to add more specific career ladders in each area and expand on salary/time expectations in other geographical locations.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
