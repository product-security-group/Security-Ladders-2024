# Security Ladders 2024

## Introduction

[**Product Security Group**](https://www.productsecuritygroup.com) (PSG) offers Security Ladders, a collection of documents to categorize the knowledge and experience expected of security experts at a given point during their careers.

## About Time

Well, yes. It has been almost 4 years since we first released our career ladders out to the world. A lot has changed both in the industry and our thinking. You will see this reflected in the new ladders and skills. More on that later.

## Why
Well, in our journey through the ranks we had to make these up as we went. That coupled with the number of folks we mentor asking us how to advance, we felt the best way to help is to open source what we developed so the community could benefit from what we have learned. They are by no means complete but they are a good start for folks that need some guidance.

## Change Log

:new: **10/14/2024** - We created a new repo and will be dropping the new ladders as they complete the peer review process. 

## LinkedIn Series

We are going to do things a bit differently this time and post out our discussions on LinkedIn. We did not get a lot of feedback on the previous platform so the hope is that we can facilitate a more lively discussion. More to come as we post.  

## General structure

### Career Stages

As we discussed in our posts, there is a new construct for career advancement we call "Career Stages". These stages are located in the following file:

* CareerStages.md 

### Skills

The area in `root` specify a career track in the security field. Initially, Security Ladders covered 5 security areas:

* Chief Information Security Officer ( CISO )
* Governance, Risk, & Compliance ( GRC )
* Security Engineering ( SECE )
* Product Security ( PSEC )
* Security Operations ( SOC )

These initially included two file types:

* [AREA]-Skills.md - Expected functional duties/knowledge
* [AREA]-Salary.md - Salary/time-at-level expectation

## How do I use these files

1. Start with the function you are looking for and locate the [AREA] files in the folder.
2. Open the file (Abbreviation)_Skills.md - this contains the functional requirements for each level.
3. Find the level you are looking for and review the skills. Reference the Career-Stages.md for more information. 
4. To determine where you sit in the salary department, we provided US salary information. Just a note: These are not based on some paid salary survey but what we actually see in the industry in the Fall of 2024.

## Contributing

PSG anticipates, with collaboration throughout the security field, to add more specific career ladders in each area and expand on salary/time expectations in other geographical locations.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
