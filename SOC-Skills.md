# Career Ladder – SOC

## Approach

As with all ladders in the version, we set out to streamline the skills and career stages to provide better clarity of what is required as you progress on your career journey. This ladder should be used in conjunction with the Career Stages ladder to provide a holistic view of both the business and technical requirements for each career stage. Each skill is assigned a number that can be used to track and correlate with external systems/processes.

**NOTE:** In Version 2.1 coming in early 2025, we will provide sample interview questions for each skill, so folks can assess a potential candidate for this level.

## Functional Areas in SOC

While most published frameworks contain SOC-related tasks, it has been our observation that few if any organizations in our target audience come anywhere near completing a fraction of these on a repeatable basis. Additionally, a few frameworks (notably NIST CSF) contain a functional area that is focused on “Recovery.” While this is a critical function, in most organizations we interact with, this responsibility is not delegated to the security team but to the more operationally focused parts of the organization with security providing a supporting role around security-related communications. As a result, we have focused the scope of skills to those that we consistently see in the majority of the target audience companies we interact with. These include:

* Detection/Monitoring – Building, deploying, and monitoring for security events   
* Response – Providing coordination to security event detection.  
* Assessments – Assessing the readiness of the organization to detect & respond to security events.  
* Program – Running a SOC practice.
