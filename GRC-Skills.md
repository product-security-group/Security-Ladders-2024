# Career Ladder – GRC

## Approach

As with all ladders in the version, we set out to streamline the skills and career stages to provide better clarity of what is required as you progress on your career journey. This ladder should be used in conjunction with the Career Stages ladder to provide a wholistic view of both the business and technical requirements for each career stage. Each skill is assigned a number that can be used to track and correlate with external systems/processes.

**NOTE:** In Version 2.1 coming in early 2025, we will provide sample interview questions for each skill, so folks can assess a potential candidate for this level.

## Functional Areas in GRC

While most published frameworks contain GRC-related tasks, it has been our observation that few if any organizations in our target audience come anywhere near completing a fraction of these on a repeatable basis. Additionally, most published frameworks do not contain the sales support function which, in our opinion, is one of the best “value adds” many GRC teams provide to the business. As a result, we have focused the scope of skills to those that we consistently see in the majority of the target audience companies we interact with. These include:

* Compliance/Certification \- Achieving & managing certifications to meet regulatory and sales requirements.  
* Risk Management – Providing basic technical risk management reviews.  
* Sales support – Answering customer inquiries around security.  
* Training – Teaching security fundamentals.  
* Program – Running a GRC practice.
