# Career Stages

As a result of the feedback, we received for version 1 of the career ladders, we have completely restructured and streamlined the general knowledge and management skills into one career stages rubric that will serve as the foundation for all the subsequent role stratifications. Let’s chat about the restructuring.

## Stages

When we dug into the details of our historical data peppered with our own experiences in the industry, it became apparent that there were roughly 4 stages for a person’s career that appeared to be loosely correlated to the amount of time spent in the role. Here is the breakdown:

* **Stage 1 – Novice** – The individual is early in their career. They need supervision and guidance as they learn the practices of the role.  
* **Stage 2- Operator** – The individual can function as an independent team member executing their role responsibilities.  
* **Stage 3- Expert** – The individual has likely reached the pinnacle of their role’s responsibilities and is pivoting to mentoring/leading other team members. In many of the roles and companies, this is the apex level for the role.  
* **Stage 4 – Visionary** – The individual has likely grown beyond the “typical” responsibilities for the role and has started to be seen as a thought leader/communicator. In many cases this role ceases to exist in the security team, and there is a pivot into a role that is outside the security organization.

There are two things we want to acknowledge:

1. **Stage does not equal HR band** – What your title/HR Band is can have little relationship to your career stage. You may hold the title of “Manager, Information Security” but you truly may be only a novice. This level of abstraction is important as you map out your career journey. You need to acquire skills and not titles to move forward.  
2. **Time Grade is Fluid** – Everyone is different. People learn skills slower/faster, are presented with more/less opportunities to grow, etc. The time grade guidelines are just that – guidelines. Please do not take these as hard and fast numbers but merely a placeholder for how long we see the “typical” person take/spend before they advance. 

## Skills

Version 1 of the ladders had a hundred skills to master/learn. In retrospect, while this was comprehensive, it was unwieldy for the end-user of the ladder. As a result, we streamlined the skills into 5 major categories. The hope is that this makes it considerably easier for folks to gauge their progress and what they need to do to advance. Here are the 5 skill breakdowns:

* **Education** – Security is a constant learning career. Your ability to learn and keep current is critical to your future success.  
* **Execution** – Ultimately, you need to deliver value to the organization through the execution of security-related projects.   
* **Collaboration** – In a modern security organization, you will need to collaborate with other team members to execute.   
* **Change Management** – Change is constant and your ability to adapt will be critical to your success.  
* **Administration** – This is the management replacement track. If your intent is to lead a security function.

## Chart

Here is the career stage chart as we see it

| Skills | Career Stages |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  | **Stage 1 – Novice** *0-3yrs* | **Stage 2 \- Operator** *3-8yrs* | **Stage 3 \- Expert** *8-15yrs* | **Stage 4 \- Visionary** *15+yrs* |
| Education | Structured Learning | Independent Learning (Internal & External) | Internal Teaching and Mentoring | External Teaching and Mentoring |
| Execution | Supervised task execution | Independent Task Execution | Task direction and leadership | Strategic execution |
| Collaboration | Team Communications/Collaboration (C/C) | Stakeholder C/C (Internal & External) | Business C/C (Internal) | Executive & Customer Communications |
| Change Management | Implementing Change | Process Improvement   | Process Creation  | Business/Industry Innovation |
| Administration | N/A | Functional Program Mgmt.  | Category Program Mgmt.  | Team & Culture Management  |

Let’s dig into the details.

### NOVICE

* **Education**\- We would expect the individual to have a formalized learning plan from the organization or a trusted advisor and they are frequently monitored for progress.  
* **Execution** – The individual is not task self-sufficient and requires direction on task content/execution as well as direct supervision of task completion.  
* **Collaboration** – We would expect the individual to have the ability to communicate with their peers in the security team across a variety of platforms.   
* **Change Management** – We would expect the individual to implement changes (technical and process) that have been developed by others.  
* **Administration** – There is no expectation of administration skills at this level.

### OPERATOR

* **Education**\- We would expect the individual to self-learn roles skills from both internal and external sources. This includes conferences, trade publications, course work, professional associations, etc.   
* **Execution** – The individual is task self-sufficient and requires limited direct supervision of task completion.  
* **Collaboration** – We would expect the individual to not only communicate within the security organization but with all task relevant stakeholders inside and outside the organization.   
* **Change Management** – We would expect the individual to recommend improvements to technical implementations and processes and have the ability to defend those recommendations to their peers.  
* **Administration** – There is an expectation the individual can manage a functional process (ex. Pentesting ) and the corresponding costs. They don’t “own” the budget but can prepare a cost estimate and ensure there are no overruns.

### EXPERT

* **Education**\- While continuing to learn, the individual at this level has pivoted to teacher/mentor by imparting their knowledge to others inside the organization.   
* **Execution** – The individual can direct tasks and provides supervision of task execution to more junior staff members.  
* **Collaboration** – We would expect the individual to broaden their collaboration to a variety of internal complementary business functions (ex. Legal, Finance, etc.).  
* **Change Management** – We would expect the individual to design new technical implementations and processes and oversee the roll-out of these within the organization.   
* **Administration** – There is an expectation the individual can manage a complete category of security (ex. Product Security) and the corresponding costs. They may own the budget, strategy, and people associated with the program.

### VISIONARY

* **Education**\- While continuing to learn, the individual at this level has pivoted to teacher/mentor by imparting their knowledge to others outside the organization by producing whitepapers, conference talks, sitting on panels, etc.   
* **Execution** – The individual can set an overall strategy for the program and ensure that the execution aligns with the overall corporate strategy.  
* **Collaboration** – We would expect the individual to collaborate with the senior executive team of the organization as well as external stakeholders (ex. Customers, Regulators, Law Enforcement, etc.).  
* **Change Management** – We would expect the individual is making recommendations of change beyond the organization by contributing to innovation within the business and the industry they reside in.  
* **Administration** – There is an expectation that the individual can potentially manage the entire security program including the operational components (budget, staff, etc.) as well as the security culture.

As you can see, this is a pretty substantial change from version 1\. Hopefully, the streamlined structure will aid you in not only assessing where you are but provide a path to a future career stage.
